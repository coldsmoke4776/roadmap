# Proficiency Roadmap

This repo is my **living ledger** of C / systems programming proficiency projects.  
The goal: kill imposter syndrome with proof — by building out each stage, piece by piece.

## Stage 1 — Data Structures & Utilities
- [x] 1.1 Vector (init/free/push_back/get/set) ✅
- [x] 1.2 Linked List ✅
- [x] 1.3 CLI Parser ✅
- [x] 1.4 String Library ✅

## Stage 2 — Custom Memory
- [x] 2.1 Allocator ✅
- [ ] 2.2 Memory Pool
- [ ] 2.3 Heap Visualizer
- [x] 2.4 Memory Dungeon ✅
...

## Stage 3 - Concurrency & Threads

- coming soon...

## Rules of Play
- Every project must compile cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -std=c11`.
- Must include **tests** (no segfaults, no silent fails).
- Memory safety checked with `valgrind` (Linux) or `leaks` (macOS).
- Code must be **understood backwards** — no cargo culting.
