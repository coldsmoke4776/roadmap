# Proficiency Roadmap

This repo is my **living ledger** of C / systems programming proficiency projects.  
The goal: kill imposter syndrome with proof — by building out each stage, piece by piece.

## Stage 1 — Data Structures & Utilities
- [x] 1.1 Vector (init/free/push_back/get/set) ✅
- [x] 1.2 Linked List ✅
- [ ] 1.3 CLI Parser
- [x] 1.4 String Library

## Stage 2 — Custom Memory
- [ ] Allocator
- [ ] Garbage Collector
...


## Rules of Play
- Every project must compile cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra -std=c11`.
- Must include **tests** (no segfaults, no silent fails).
- Memory safety checked with `valgrind` (Linux) or `leaks` (macOS).
- Code must be **understood backwards** — no cargo culting.
